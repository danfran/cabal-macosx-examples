Example: gtkHello
=================

This example illustrates the use of cabal-macosx for building a
graphical OS X application based on the gtk2hs toolkit.  The
application in question is a basic `Hello World'.

To build the application, follow the usual steps:

    runghc Setup configure
    runghc Setup build

This will create an application bundle in dist, which can be run from
the terminal

    open ./dist/build/GtkHello.app

or copied elsewhere and run via the finder.
