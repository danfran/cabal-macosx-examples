# cabal-macosx-examples

Here you can find some examples to implement the usage of [cabal-macosx](https://github.com/danfran/cabal-macosx) for Haskell.

## Examples

* gtkHello - basic gtk2hs example, demonstrating ordinary usage.

* wxHello - basic wx example, demonstrating ordinary usage.

* wxHello-cpp - same, but with wxHello.cabal and Setup.hs modified so that the dependency on cabal-macosx only exists on OSX.
