Example: wxHello-cpp
====================

This is a modified version of the wxHello example which shows how to
remove the dependency on cabal-macosx when on non-OSX platforms.

cabal-macosx is only relevant on OSX; if used on any other platform,
it does nothing.  Thus, you can always safely include it in your
program's Build-Depends and Setup.hs, whatever the target platform.
However, you might not want to do that.  This example shows how to
modify your .cabal file and your Setup.hs so that cabal-macosx is only
required on OSX.

There are three changes necessary to create this platform-sensitivity:

  1. wxHello.cabal is modified so that cabal-macosx is only in the
     Build-Depends list if the O/S is darwin.

  2. Setup.hs is modified so that cabal-macosx code is only imported
     and compiled if the O/S is darwin.

  3. Calls to runghc Setup.hs are given the -cpp flag to invoke the C
     preprocessor, eg: "runghc -cpp Setup configure".

In all other respects this example is identical to the plain wxHello
example.

Please see the README for the plain wxHello example for any further
information.
